    Evaluating Software Safety Standards: A Systematic Review and Comparison
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    As part of an undergraduate research project at the University of Texas at Dallas, I contributed to a publication in the IEEE. The study systematically evaluated and compared software engineering safety standards from various institutions. We cross-referenced these standards' compliance with a set of best practices derived from software-related accidents.
