  Software engineer specializing in scalable, reliable and performant system design and development.
  With experience on a variety of global-scale systems, including work at both Google and Amazon, I enjoy implementing
  cost-effective software systems to meet the needs of growing businesses.
  My work includes low latency APIs, efficient large-scale batch data processing using systems such as MapReduce and Spark, along
  with scalable and responsive database design on a variety of platforms including Google Cloud Spanner and DynamoDB. I design and implement code with
  a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented design principles and testability.
# Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.

# You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else markdown supports such as
#   - Lists
#   - Tables
#   - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
#   - Images

  When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me somewhere outside when it's warm. I live in Colorado
  with my life partner Collin, and love exploring the beautiful new parts of this state with my dogs Atlas and Kapua.
